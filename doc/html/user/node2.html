The Software Development Environment (<i> SDE</i> ) is an attempt to provide a
simple, friendly environment for the <em> development</em> of imaging algorithms.
It has many strange and wonderful algorithms not found in other packages.
The useful ones are supposed to migrate to more common packages, but it
doesn't always work that way.
<P>
<i> SDE</i>  is characterized by relatively close ties to the unix family of
operating systems and by the assumption that virtual memory is plentiful.
Rather than reinvent the operating system and insulate the programmer
from the vagaries of many divergent platforms, <i> SDE</i>  sacrifices some
portability in the name of simplicity and relies as much as possible
on native tools and OS support.  The assumption of plentiful physical and
virtual memory leads to the common practice of loading all image and
visibility data completely into memory for the duration of their use.
This greatly reduces the burden of memory management on the programmer
and has the side effect of allowing algorithms to proceed at maximum
speed in the common case where all data can fit within physical memory.
The tradeoff is that there will be some problems that will not fit
into virtual memory which might be handled by a sequential disk based
philosophy.  Fortunately this is rarely a problem.

<P>
Greyscale image display tools within <i> SDE</i>  are fairly primitive.  For
interactive examination of FITS images in a workstation environment,
SAOimage is the tool of choice.  Since SAOimage was designed to work
with IRAF, FITS files are not the default, and it must be invoked with
the <tt> -fits</tt> command line option like
<P>
<tt> saoimage -fits IMG.35A</tt>
<P>
A critical function filled by SAOimage is the specification of cursors.
Many SDE imaging tasks can take an arbitrary image as a window
specification.  The usual convention is that flux is allowed where ever the
window image is greater than zero.  These window images (also called masks
or boxes by various tasks) can be produced by manipulating existing images
or they can be specified interactively with SAOimage.
<P>
Within SAOimage there are a host of ways that regions can be specified.
First read in an image of the sky containing the region desired.  Typically
this is an unwindowed deconvolved image or flux model.  Cursors are
specified in a fairly intuitive way via the mouse and buttons under the
<i> Cursor</i> menu.  Once a cursor is satisfactory, type 's' in the SAOimage
window to save the current cursor to an internal list.  The saved list is
written to a file via the <i> write</i> button in the <i> region</i> submenu,
and produces a file something like this:
<P>
<PRE># IMG.35A
# Thu Jul 14 08:03:18 1994
# shape x, y, [x dimension, y dimension], [angle]
 ELLIPSE(127.69,128.08,8.69,3.62,19.983)
 POINT(126.50,142.25)
 POINT(113.50,117.25)
 POLYGON(116.50,134.00,124.25,136.00,119.50,139.50,18.50,14.25,108.75,139.50)
</PRE>
<P>
With some restrictions, this file can be read directly by any <i> SDE</i> \
task which expects a window image.  The caveat is that these files do
not have an embedded coordinate system.  They make sense only relative
to some reference image.  <i> SDE</i>  will attempt to read the image in the
first line to find the coordinate system.  So long as this image is
available, all is well.  Problems can emerge if the cursor files are
copied across directories.  A simple fix here is to edit the reference
image specification in the cursor file to include a fully qualified
directory.  Alternatively, if the reference image is to be modified or
deleted, one can use the task <tt> mask</tt> and mode <tt> SAO</tt> to produce
a FITS image of the cursor file.  This is independent of the
reference, and if the <tt> MShrink</tt> option is used, need not be
particularly large.  The disadvantage is that window images, as
opposed to the cursor files from SAOimage, must have the same cell
size as the image on which they will be used.
<P>
It is worth emphasizing again that the <i> SDE</i>  window philosophy is that
positions on the sky are selected.  Provided that all the coordinate systems
necessary can be found, different image geometries between mask, reference
and target will be handled properly.
<P>
We currently run a locally modified version of SAOimage that has
several bug fixes and minor enhancements over the original.  The
sophisticated SAOimage user should read the files in
tools/saoimage.l2/doc and also tools/saoimage.l2/README.local to
become aware of several additional subtleties and workarounds.
<P>
For working hardcopy output, SAOimage can print directly.  For
publication quality output, the task <tt> imgplot</tt> may be used.  <tt>
imgplot</tt> can read the color files produced by SAOimage, and can
emulate most of its scaling functions.  Thus the greyscale transfer
function can be adjusted interactively with the cursor within
SAOimage, written to a color file, and used to produce high quality
final hardcopy faithful to what is displayed on the screen.
<P>
Alternatively, the images may be read into <IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img2.gif">  or some other package
for final display.  In <IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img3.gif"> , use IMLOD with INFILE set to
e.g. 'T:BF7.ICLN' where T is the environment variable used for your
directory.

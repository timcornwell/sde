<i> SDE</i>  tasks primarily use FITS files as both their storage and their
interchange format.  The images written in this format can be read by
nearly any image processing package that understands FITS.  The
visibility databases are written in random groups FITS format, and
should be readable by any package capable of doing sensible things
with them.  Some nonstandard objects such as complex images must be
stored in native <i> SDE</i>  format, which merely dumps an entire subtree of
the memory database to disk in an architecture dependent manner.
Anything can be written as a <tt> .SDE</tt> file, but the only thing which
can be done with these files is read them back into <i> SDE</i> .  Their
advantage is slightly faster IO speed and guaranteed bitwise fidelity.
FITS images are machine independent, portable to many packages, and
can be examined directly by SAOimage, so FITS storage is preferable
when possible.
<P>
Several other files types are supported in limited contexts.  PGM images
serve as an entry point to a wide variety of image display and processing
software, including <tt> xv</tt>.  Excel pixel lists are the format required
by the general purpose fitting program, <tt> gaussfit</tt>, and is commonly
supported by spreadsheets.  Some of the least used list based formats have
simply been supported by short awk scripts found in the bin/unix area
which convert to and from the standard <i> SDE</i>  model format.
<P>
In the following table, the fixed extension can be used to force SDE
to write a file of a given type when there is more than one possibility.
The default is FITS format.

<P>
A fairly promising deconvolution algorithm has been implemented, based on
Non Negative Least Squares matrix inversion.  The task <tt>svdconv</tt>
performs several algebraic deconvolution algorithms, NNLS among them.  The
algorithm is a quite straightforward application of a rather complicated
preexisting constrained linear algebra algorithm.  The task forms the
matrix connecting an arbitrary region in the dirty map with another
arbitrary region in the component plane, and solves the resulting algebraic
equations with the NNLS algorithm from Lawson &Hanson.  NNLS deconvolution
is somewhat slower than existing algorithms for compact sources, and very
much slower for extended objects.  The advantage is very high precision
deconvolution, in particular when used in the hybrid mapping loop for
VLBI.  Memory is the limiting factor to the source size that can be
deconvolved.  One copy of the beam matrix must be held in memory, of size
<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_29697_tex2html_wrap235.xbm">, where <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_29697_tex2html_wrap237.xbm"> is the number of pixels in the dirty
map used as input to the algorithm, and <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_29697_tex2html_wrap239.xbm"> is the number of pixels
where the algorithm is allowed to place flux.  It is important that this
fit into physical memory, as once page swapping sets in performance
degrades dramatically, and problems that were just practical become quite
impractical.  Running time is roughly proportional to
<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_29697_tex2html_wrap241.xbm">, and also varies with the SNR of the data, with
higher quality data taking longer to process.  Currently a map with
approximately 6000 pixels of significant emission and high SNR can be
deconvolved in several hours on an IBM RS/6000.
<P>
When used in NNLS mode, many of the inputs to <tt>svdconv</tt> can be
ignored.  Simply set <tt>Algorithm=NNLS</tt>, and ensure that <tt>Dirty</tt>,
<tt>PSF</tt>, <tt>DataWindow</tt>, and <tt>FluxWindow</tt> all have reasonable
values.  <tt>Dirty</tt> and <tt>PSF</tt> are images that have been made with <tt>uvmap</tt>.  <tt>DataWindow</tt> is the region of the dirty map that is to be used
as input to the algorithm.  It is either an image or a cursor file as
described in the section on SAOimage.  Generally the data window should be
set as large as possible within convenient computational limits.  So long
as this includes all regions of significant flux, the details of the window
probably won't make much difference.  The flux window is essentially a
CLEAN box.  It determines where the algorithm is allowed to place flux.
For the purpose of deconvolving a well calibrated image, this also does not
matter terribly so long as all regions of significant flux are included.
For the purposes of making a self calibration model, it is more important
that the flux window approximate the support of the source, but NNLS is
still less sensitive to the details of the window that CLEAN.  The task
will print out a status message the first few times through its main loop,
and somewhat less frequently thereafter.  The residual, component model,
and restored image can be written out with the <tt>Residual</tt>, <tt>Components</tt>, and <tt>Image</tt> adverbs.  As with all deconvolvers in <i>SDE</i>,
the restored image is the smoothed components plus the residual image.  If
the NNLS model is to be taken into <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_29697_tex2html_wrap243.xbm">, use the task <tt>img2list</tt> with
<tt>Mode=&gt;CC</tt> to write the component model as an ASCII file which can be
read into <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_29697_tex2html_wrap245.xbm"> with <tt>TBIN</tt>.
<P>
There is a more sophisticated task, <tt>inls</tt>, which attempts to
iteratively improve a model too large for <tt>svdconv</tt> using NNLS minor
cycles.  Unfortunately results to date have been disappointing and its use
is quite experimental.

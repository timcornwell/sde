<H2><A NAME=SECTION0006100000000000000> Exotic Weightings</A></H2>
<P>
Most of the deconvolvers found in <i>SDE</i> operate in the image plane.  These
tasks all take the dirty map and dirty beam as input.  Consequently most of
the exotic weighting strategies are found in the task which creates the
dirty beam and map, <tt>uvmap</tt>.  These are not yet found in the integrated
mapping/selfcal task, <tt>dragon</tt> or the visibility based maximum entropy
task, <tt>viswd40</tt>.
<P>
The field of view parameter, <tt>FOV</tt>, controls the fraction of the map
over which sidelobes of the dirty beam are to be minimized.  <tt>FOV=1.0</tt>
corresponds to the usual uniform weighting.  <tt>FOV=0.333</tt> will optimize
over the inner ninth of the map by area, and is similar to <tt>UVBOX=1</tt>
within <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_29697_tex2html_wrap231.xbm">.  This is often called superuniform weighting, and usually
results in a somewhat smaller main beam and uglier sidelobes.  In general,
<tt>FOV=1/(2n+1)</tt> is similar to <tt>UVBOX=n</tt>.
<P>
Robust weighting is selected by setting the option <tt>RMode</tt> to <tt>NORM</tt>, and the position along the Resolution-SNR tradeoff curve is
controlled by the value of the parameter, <tt>Robust</tt>.  In these units,
<tt>Robust=0.0</tt> will likely end up near the knee of the tradeoff curve,
with a value of <tt>Robust=2.0</tt> being nearly indistinguishable from
natural weighting.  <tt>Robust=-2.0</tt> will be very close to whatever
weighting is selected by <tt>FOV</tt>.  The software which produces the
tradeoff curves is currently a cranky shellscript and not suitable for
public use.  Consequently, one must simply try a few values of <tt>Robust</tt>
to find one suitable for your project.  Set the value of <tt>FitPSF</tt> to
<tt>True</tt>, set <tt>Dirty</tt> and <tt>PSF</tt> to null values, and everything
else as you wish.  No output files will be written, and <tt>uvmap</tt> will
produce a report including something like the following:

<P>
<tt>uvmap</tt> reports the expected thermal RMS noise in the dirty map in
normalized units such that natural weighting is 1.0.  Other weightings will
typically produce a value one to several times greater than this.  In this
case it is 1.969 times worse than natural weighting.  The other information
of interest is the fitted beam size, which is given as the major and minor
axis in arcsecond and the position angle in degrees from North through
East.  There are three fits given, each with a different criteria for the
fit.  The linear beam fit is what is used in <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_29697_tex2html_wrap233.xbm"> and the non-linear fit
will be slightly more accurate for projects needing precise photometry.
Take your pick, they're rarely very different.  For the moment, one merely
adjusts the value of <tt>Robust</tt> until a reasonable tradeoff between
resolution and SNR is found.
<P>
Gridless weighting is selected by setting the logical option <tt>GridWeights</tt> to <tt>False</tt>.  This options calculates the true local weight
density by directly examining the distance between every pair of points in
the database.  This avoids certainly kinds of gridding errors where some
points are weighted anomalously high.  The routine is slower than the
normal weighting routine, but it is clever enough about caching
intermediate results that it is not unusably slow.  This is mostly useful
for super-uniformly weighted data sets, or those with very short
integration times.  If more than a small amount of robustness is used,
gridless weighting is probably not needed.  When mapping out the robustness
tradeoff curve as above, one can save the results of the weight density
calculation from one run of <tt>uvmap</tt> to be used in the next.  If <tt>SaveWeights</tt> is non-null, the weight density will be written to that file.
If <tt>ReadWeights</tt> is non-null, the weight density will be read from the
file.  Be careful when using <tt>ReadWeights</tt>.  If anything that affects
the gridding geometry has changed, (nearly any parameter besides the
robustness), the weights will not be correct.

Wide field imaging has changed substantially over the past few years.
The best task to use now is dragon. This performs the <em> polyhedron</em>
clean described by Cornwell and Perley, 1992, together with optional
selfcalibration steps.
<P>
<OL><LI> Export the u,v data to SDE using FITTP to write a disk-FITS.
Put the file in an area of your own and cd to it.

<LI> Run dragon to make a clean image and self-calibrated 
data. For 327MHz observing of the full primary beam in
D-configuration, typical inputs are:

This makes a 7 by 7 faceted image, where each facet has 100 by 100
pixels each of cell size 60 arcseconds. The Stokes switch specifies
that in the selfcal step, RR and LL are to be calibrated separately.
FOV=1 specifies uniform weighting (use 0.0 for natural). Muvlimits
sets the range of spacings used to calculate gains in the selfcal
step. NewVis writes the selfcalibrated data set.  FSelfcal
determines levels of peak residual at which selfcalibration will be
performed. FSwitch specifies that a DFT is to be used for pixels
brighter than 10 mJy/beam. Tamp and Tphase set the time scales for
amplitude and phase solutions (usually you set the former to a larger
number). Reference sets the reference field for which noise levels are
calculated. TVImage specifies an image to display (-1 means none, and
0 means all). Np=3 specifies that (2*Np+1)**2 patches will be used
(e.g. 49 for np=3).

program flydoc.

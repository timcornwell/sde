<P>
The Software Development Environment (<i>SDE</i> ) is an attempt to provide a
simple, friendly environment for the <em>development</em> of imaging algorithms.
The principal features of <i>SDE</i> are:
<UL><LI> High level handling of images and visibility databases as complete 
entities.  Inside an <i>SDE</i> program, an image can be referred to by a
name such as <tt>`PointSpreadFunction'</tt> or <tt>`XFR'</tt>.
<LI> A fairly complete collection of modules for handling images, etc.
in sophisticated ways. For example, a Fourier transform can be performed
with the call:
<PRE><TT>
        CALL IMGFFT ('PointSpreadFunction', 'XFR')</TT></PRE>
At this level, routines are written so that all the information
neccessary for performing the transform is associated with the names of
entities.
<LI> All data is assumed to fit into memory (either physical or virtual)
and so little explicit i/o is required.
<LI> All application code is written in Fortran-77. Some system code is
written in c. 
</UL>
The <i>SDE</i> was designed by Tim Cornwell and Pat Moore in late 1986 and
early 1987. Much of the system code was written by Pat during that
time. Most of the application code has been developed by Tim Cornwell,
Mark Holdaway, Dan Briggs, and Ralph Marson.
<P>
The <i>SDE</i> is not intended to replace large production systems such as
AIPS or IRAF, but rather to provide a friendly environment for the
development of algorithms. It is intended that once an algorithm has been
written and tested using SDE, it should be ported to a production
system like AIPS. <i>SDE</i> is not supported by NRAO on any machines. Take it
as you find it.

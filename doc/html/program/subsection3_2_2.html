The principal motivation for writing the <i>SDE</i> was the observation that
the bulk of the code in any image processing task is concerned with
things which are extraneous to the actual algorithm. For example, the
user interface, the file system, the history mechanism, the error
checking mechanism all usually take many lines of code in most
systems, while the actual algorithm can consist of a few lines of
code. Hence, while the logical operations inside a task may be quite
simple, it may be very difficult to discover them from the code or to
augment them significantly. This makes both code maintenance and code
development difficult and inordinately time-consuming. We decided to
build a very modular system. Some of the advantages of modularity are
obvious, others less so:
<UL><LI> Code can be re-used where required. Ordinary subroutines are good
examples.
<LI> Information can be hidden from the programmer. With a nice, clean
interface specification, something quite complicated can be made to
look simple. 
<LI> Modules can be changed internally without changing the external
appearance. Hence maintenance and development is easier.
<LI> Psychologically, it helps to break a complex problem into small
parts, each of which can be attacked independently.
<LI> Modules can be contributed by many different people provided that
the interfaces are well-specified.
<LI> Modules usually force the production of routines in which the
action of a routine is not subtly dependent on the state of global
variables which may be in an uncertain state.
</UL>
In practice, clean definition of modules requires a high-level description
of the things to be operated on. Fortran cannot do this very well. For
example, an image logically consists of a number of things: the actual
pixel values, the dimensions, the units, the coordinates, the history, and
so on. In a decent language these things can be assembled into a single
structure, apointer to which can be passed around easily. In Fortran, the 
lack of structures and pointers leads one into the temptation of letting the
innards of a thing like an image be spread all around: in a variable here,
a <tt>COMMON</tt> block there. The applications programmer then has to
handle all this stuff explicitly. Use of c would solve some of these
problems but would introduce others because of it's unsuitability for 
numerical work. Another solution would be to use a higher
level language like ADA, but in reality most machines do not have
good compilers for the modern languages. In <i>SDE</i> this dilemma is resolved by
developing a mechanism for handling structures in Fortran. We designed
and coded a hierarchical database system, written in c, which allows the use
of structures. With a few conventions for coding, it allows one to
call subroutines which look like:
<PRE><TT>
      CALL VISGRID('Vis', 'OBS/I', 'GriddedVis', .TRUE.)</TT></PRE>
for the gridding of visibility data (Observed Stokes I), or
<PRE><TT>
      CALL IMGCCLEA ('Dirty', 'PSF', 'XFR', 'CCLEAN', 
     1   'Resid', 'Vis')</TT></PRE>
to perform a Barry Clark clean of a dirty image.
<P>
Other important design choices were:
<UL><LI> We decided to concentrate on applications software, and to
rely upon the host-operating system for file handling, tape access, etc.
We simply did not have the resources to re-design all that stuff.
SDE can easily be made to run on most UNIX machines.
<LI> We decided that array processors were a thing of the past. We
would concentrate on writing vectorizable code on machines like the
Convex C-1.
<LI> We decided to use a simple user-interface initially. We hope to
change this one day, but again this was low on our list of priorities.

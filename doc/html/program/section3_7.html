Currently, <i>SDE</i> works on the CRAY 2, CONVEX C-1 and C-2, the SUN 3/60,
SUN SPARC machines, and IBM RS/6000. Porting <i>SDE</i> to these machines was
not too onerous. Distinctions between machines are handled by compiler
directives in the code. Hence there is only one copy of the code, but
there may be multiple versions of the code inside one file. The
c-preprocessor is used to branch under the control of various
definitions passed down from the compilation. The current allowed
definitions are:
<P><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_29564_tabbing385.xbm"><P>
One of each of these three classes must be chosen. For example, the
Fortran and c compilers on yucca are called with flags '-DOS_BSD-DMACH_C1-DCOMP_CONVEX'. For e.g. the Convex C1, this is controlled
by the file <tt>var/comopt.c1</tt>.
<P>
The steps required to port to another machine are:
<UL><LI> Install <i>SDE</i> on your machine from a tar tape or file. You can put
it anywhere, as long as you change the environment variable $SDEROOTto point to the right place. <b>You must set $SDEROOTbefore
calling sdeini or sdeini.csh</b>. Local definitions belong in a file
called <tt>var/sdeini.hostname</tt> or <tt>var/sdeini.csh.hostname</tt>.
<LI> <tt>var/sdeini.hostname</tt> or <tt>var/sdeini.csh.hostname</tt> 
will need changes to include another machine type and other
directories. Check that all the logical names defined here are
sensible.
<LI> The compiler options are set by the Bourne-shell routine 
<tt>var/comopt.$MACHINE</tt>. Here you should insert some definitions
appropriate for your machine. See <tt>var/comopt.sparc4.1</tt> for the definitions
of the definitions.
<LI> Find out how c and Fortran talk to each other. On most compilers, the
cross-language calls are fairly simple. Addresses are passed as usual.
Although for most compilers, the length of <tt>CHARACTER*(*)</tt> strings
is usually appended to the argument list, the CRAY compilers do
something much more inscrutable so that we adopt a general solution of
passing the lengths explicitly.  See the routines in source/main/dat.f
and source/main/dai.c for how this is done under the currently
supported machines. This will probably work for other machines so you
probably won't have to worry about it. One other concern is the naming
conventions. Most compilers append an underscore to c routine names,
whilst the CRAY compiler uses upper case names with no underscore.
This is handled by using the preprocessor to redefine Fortran-callable
names in c routines.
<LI> Some compilers cannot handle certain types of operation. String
operations are notoriously error-prone. In particular, 
functions which return a 
<tt>CHARACTER*(*)</tt> string are often mis-compiled. This is awkward for
<i>SDE</i> since it uses lots of strings. The current code seems to work on 
several otherwise buggy compilers, though, so this may not be too much of
a problem. The secret seems to be to have only one place in such a routine
where the returned value is actually set.
<LI> The crucial routines are stored in source/main. These routines MUST
work if the system is to work at all. A good way to start an installation is
to make these work and then run the task world which simply prints out
'Hello, world'. The C-shell procedure sdeinstall will make the relevant
directories and then build the minimal system
and run the task world. It then goes on to do a full make of the entire 
system including all other subroutines and tasks.
<LI> The directory test contains scripts for testing a working version of 
SDE. A script <tt>timer</tt> will run through a number of key tasks.
The output from certified runs on various machines is also present.
<P>
</UL>
<P>
Once the system is up and running, you can worry about some niceties:
<UL><LI> The task <tt>sde</tt> maintains a file specifying the environment of sde
programs. This controls the editor used in the user interface, the
default type of FITS written (e.g. 16 bit, 32 bit integer or IEEE floating
point). Each task tries to read sde.cur from either the current
directory or from $HOMEso you may customize either your whole area
or a given sub-directory.
<LI> A fairly good FFT comes with <i>SDE</i> (see source/fft/fftx.f) but
hand-coded routines are often available and are nearly always much
better.  Since FFTs are critical to imaging, it is worth getting a
good one. On yucca, we use the CONVEX VECLIB routine. This is about
twice as fast as the standard <i>SDE</i> routine: the CONVEX routine takes
3-4 msec per 1024-point complex FFT.  On the CRAY 2, the hand-coded
routine is about 10 times faster. It is also worth using
machine-specific real-to-complex and complex-to-real FFT routines (see
source/fft/fftr.f for examples of the use of the CRAY2 routines).
<LI> On machines which have the capability, memory can be mapped to disk
space. This avoids filling the system swapping space with <i>SDE</i> arrays.
On yucca, location of these is controlled by the SDESCR and SDESCRn
logical names.  The n'th big array (big is greater than SDEMEM Mbytes
where the environment variable SDEMEM defaults to 8) is put on disk
SDESCRn, and the default is SDESCR.  Each file has the name
SDESCRxppppp where ppppp is the process id and x is a character chosen
to make the name unique (The unix routine mktemp does this part).
<LI> On the Convex's and Sun's, we use an interrupt handler which allows
graceful stopping of various tasks. Control-C will call up an
interactive interrupt handler. To get a non-interactive job to quit as
soon as possible, send it a SIGQUIT signal i.e. do kill -3
process-number.  See source/start/start.f for details.

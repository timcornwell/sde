This is actually only a small subset of the full LAPACK library, just enough
to run the SVD routines in single and double precision.  If we need new
LAPACK routines, as eventually we probably will, I suggest obtaining them
through the Web, via: GAMS : Guide to Available Mathematical Software, at
http://gams.cam.nist.gov/.  The routines so obtained will have to be
integrated with the files here.

As of now, the libraries have been compiled for SUN4 and RIOS, and
the respective comopt files modified to include them.  Other architectures
will have to do the same when the libraries become needed on them.

For the moment we're just compiling by hand.

PI varies in definition through out SDE				7/8/92

Problem with non-square images in smoothing routines		7/8/92

Trying to print the value of hidden parameters with a simple
/parameter, (as opposed to trying to set one with
/parameter=value), causes the DATGET routines to error
with an argument mismatch, and the task to exit.  This also
overwrites the *.cur file with the default values.  :(
Very annoying, and should be looked at.
